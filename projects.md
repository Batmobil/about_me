Here is a non-exhaustive list of my projects. You can also check out my Github profile <a href="https://github.com/Batmobil">here</a> for a complete list of my projects.

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Jobs Postings Dashboard</b>: These project was started as a way to learn and play with Flask web frameworkd and Plotly-Dash package to realize a dashboard of jobs postings of data-analysts, data-scientists positions and compare the availabilities in two Canadian cities: Montreal and Vancouver. It was a good introduction to both web and use of a web framework like Flask and to the use of Dash components. I was very impressed by the easy way Dash provde flexible components to set up great visualization (even if pure react words cloud component remains to be created though). <i>projects.md</i> file<br>
