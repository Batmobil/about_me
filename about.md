Hello, I'm Baptiste Delattre, Data Scientist. Since my Master Degree in physics engineering, I had the opportunities to work on several projects concerning Data Analysis and engineering as a creation and maintenance of a data Pipeline with R, Python, Airflow and cloud services like AWS. I also enjoy trying new visualisation tools like <a href="https://superset.incubator.apache.org/"> Apache Superset</a> or <a href="https://dash.plot.ly/getting-started">Plotly-Dash</a>. From time to time, I try to follow some contest on Kaggle. Also in this fast evolving field I like to stay up to date with state of the art techniques following online courses on Coursera, Full Stack Deep Learning or other MOOC platforms.

Recently, I had a personal interest in data science/engineering computations using GPU, notably the <a href="https://rapids.ai/about.html">RAPIDS initiative</a>.
The computation time gain is very interesting for Big Data processing provided that you have access to GPUs to execute your code and that your code can be operated in parallel.

On my free time, I like to practice climbing, handball and hiking in the beatiful province of Quebec in Canada.
I also enjoy science-fiction novels or essays from time to time.

If I can help you in any data-related challenge you might encounter or you simply want to connect, feel free to write me at my email address appearing below.
